# Busy-Blogger

In this project we had to build a blog site where people can sign up and sign in to there account. They can also post blogs and view other people's blogs as well. The biggest problem I faced in this project was getting the server to run properly but after speaking with a TA I was able to get the app to run properly. This is a particular project that I am very proud of because it is honestly one of my best so far.
